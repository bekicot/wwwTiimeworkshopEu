---


At this conference people are working towards a better understanding and developing new concepts, 
using an agile format with participant-driven contents, covering the attendees’ current interests. 
TIIME's format has been designed for solving trust and identity issues. If you 
are looking for a substantial discussion on this subject it is likely that you will meet the right 
people here!

Sessions will be run in an agile format centering the subtopics on the actual interests 
of the participants. Interest, questions or contributions can be posted in the pre-conference survey. 


### Authentication, Attributes, Federation and Crypto

Identity federation has been thriving in certain vertical domains and is increasingly arriving in various 
industry sectors to support ever more business processes. Organizations have to choose from different 
functions, architectures and protocols; available as cloud service, drop-in solution or toolkits. This 
topic is for you if SAML, OAUTH, OpenID Connect, WS-Fed, SCIM, SPML should match with authentication and 
provisioning processes in a multi-party context.


### Privacy and Identity

While “better” identities like Facebook’s real names or government issued eIDs relieve certain security 
threats, they are against certain privacy principles and result in a shifted risk equation. What are the 
positions, options and best practices for actors in this ecosystem, joining different jurisdictions across 
the Internet?

### Assurance, Business Cases, Policy and Governance
    
Legal and organizatonal frameworks need to evolve to make corss-organizational cooperation scalable and
resilient. Stakeholdes with different points of view need to articulare legal opinions, local vs.
 common needs, organitational contraints and contrast differnt models.
